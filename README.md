# AndroidStudioProjects

Welcome to my collection of Android Studio projects created during my Mobile Programming class in 2023. This repository serves as a live archive documenting the various exercises and assignments I've tackled using Java throughout the course.

## About the Repository

The content here reflects hands-on practice and my evolving understanding of Android development. Each directory houses an individual project or task that corresponds to a specific lesson from the curriculum.

## Course Overview

In this Mobile Programming class, our main objective was to learn how to develop mobile applications on the Android platform, given its vast market share among mobile OSs. The class is structured to combine one hour of online learning with two hours of in-person or real-time instruction per week.
